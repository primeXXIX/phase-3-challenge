## Part 1: Simple web app

Build a very basic web API which conforms to the routes listed below.

Use Express. You don't need to use an HTML templater like EJS or Pug. (You can use `curl` or `Postman` to check whether the routes work)

The web server should provide the following routes:

```
GET /api/shout/:word
POST /api/array/merge
```

#### Route 1: GET /api/shout/:word
Shout the word back! Return the value of the URL parameter `:word` converted to ALL CAPS and with three exclamation points added to the end.

Example requests:
```
request: GET /api/shout/popcorn
response: POPCORN!!!
status: 200

request: GET /api/shout/friday
response: FRIDAY!!!
status: 200
```
#### Route 2: POST /api/array/merge
When given a request with a JSON body containing two arrays (at keys "a" and "b"), it will respond with JSON containing two arrays merged together at the key "result". By merging array "b" into array "a", the new array will have all the elements from each, but alternating between them. For example:

```javascript
merge([1,2,3], [10,11,12]) => [1,10,2,11,3,12]
```

Example requests:
```
request: POST /api/array/merge
request body: {"a": ["one","two"],
               "b": ["three","four"]}
request content type: application/json
response status code: 200
response: {"result": ["one","three","two","four"]}
response content type: application/json

request: POST /api/array/merge
request body: {: [50,"a": [10,100],
               "b"500]}
request content type: application/json
response status code: 200
response: {"result": [10,50,100,500]}
response content type: application/json

request: POST /api/array/merge
request body: {"a": "abcd",
               "b": [5,6]}
request content type: application/json
response status code: 400
response: {"error": "Both keys in request body must be of type Array."}
response content type: application/json
```
